# Core
A Computercraft API in which many different things can be accomplished with. Simple things like loading APIs in an order by calling "RequireAPI" or bigger things like making an interactive operating system with actual graphical menus and widows. It all can be done!

## Objectives
There are many objectives in this project. The issue is trying to address all of them and actually get some done.
### CPI
- [x] A way for libraries to plug in to other libraries in a safe way.
- [x] A logging system for any debugging needed which sends data remotley through a modem.
### Renderer
- [x] An entire rendering system with objective hooks which allow other apis and programs to manipulate geometrical shapes all from one object.
- [ ] The ability to move, scale, and change values of each object also.

## Setting Up a Copy
Setting up a copy of the project is rather simple. Just git a copy (fork if you want), and simply execute the start.bat in the main directory. This will Launch the computercraft emulator. The emulator has a session already loaded with the core api project loaded on it. Here is a full set of instructions below.
* Download a copy and open the main folder
